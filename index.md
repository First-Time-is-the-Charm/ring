# Create your own

This particular webring sucks. It's just two personal sites and my GitHub profile! To make a real one that isn't just a tech demo, fork [this repo]({{site.repository}}), customize `_config.yml`, replace `_websites` with your own list of sites, then enable GitHub pages on your fork!
